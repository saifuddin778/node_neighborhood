# node_neighborhood
Nodes. Neighbors. Reduction.

Systematic reduction of neighborhood around a node in a 2D lattice. Run the file named main.py and provide the lattice size values (n, m => should be positive integers equal to each other since we are dealing with a lattice). The simulation will print all the nodes in the neighborhood over each iteration, until the last node left is the randomly picked node from the `simulate()` method itself.
